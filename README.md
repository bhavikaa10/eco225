**Innovation & CO₂ Emissions: An Empirical Global Analysis**

This project explores the relationship between targeted innovation and per capita CO₂ emissions across 130+ countries using data from the Global Innovation Index (GII) and the Carbon Budget. It was completed as part of an upper-year Economics course at the University of Toronto.

**📄 Project Summary**

Investigates whether countries that innovate more also emit less carbon per capita.

Focuses on targeted innovation areas like green tech, infrastructure, and institutional quality.

Uses a combination of OLS regression, log transformation, and scikit-learn models.

Data visualizations created in Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
